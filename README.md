# Missing Data Testing

Missing Data Testing is a collection of R scripts for testing imputation accuracy and computation time using a variety of imputation techniques as described in JBHI-00775-2020

## Installation

Download and Run. Requires the ADNIMERGE package  (adni.loni.usc.edu) to be installed in R if using the same data as in the paper. 



## Usage

 Create a new R project and run the scripts. Steps 0-4 are for imputation accuracy and time testing ( results shown in Fig. 4 in paper)

#Step 5 onwards is for the imputation + classification LOOCV accuracy and time testing (results shown in Fig. 5 in paper)

#MATLAB code for Figure 4 and 5 is also included.
